## Contribution

### `npm run prepare`

First, prepare [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky).

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
